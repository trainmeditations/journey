# Journey
A blog engine written in Go, compatible with Ghost themes.

## Fork info
This project has been forked from [Kabukky](https://github.com/kabukky/journey) as his repo is out of date and seems to be mostly abandoned. My goals are to get the code up to date and automatically building with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/trainmeditations/journey), then be packaged into docker images. For minimal packaging I'm building static binaries.

I'd prefer not to rely on cgo bindings if possible and may look at modifying the database code in the future. I may make other small changes from time to time. Otherwise I will keep an eye out for patches from upstream or other forks, and will consider pull requests made to this repo.

Please refer to upstream [README](https://github.com/kabukky/journey/blob/master/README.md) or [wiki](https://github.com/kabukky/journey/wiki) for further information about Journey itself.
